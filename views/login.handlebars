    <h2>Hello! <br> This is the Stevens MarketPlace</h2>
    <p id="projectDescription">
      This website acts as a Marketplace for Stevens Institute of Technology. People at Stevens Institute of
      Technology
      will be able to buy and sell the commodities of their wish. Users who want to sell the items will be able to
      post
      them on the site, and other users will be able to view the posted commodities and buy them if interested.
      <br>
      This application mainly helps students at Stevens Institute of Technology. A considerable percentage of
      students
      rely on unknown sellers to buy the commodities, and this application allows students to overcome this
      disadvantage.
      Additionally, numerous students are graduating every year, and new students join Stevenâ€™s; this application
      might
      help pass out students to sell the commodities and incoming students to buy them.
